Key Concepts:
Escrow is a financial agreement where funds are held by a neutral third party until certain conditions are met.

Commonly used when transferring value in exchange for goods or services.

In blockchain, the smart contract itself acts as the trusted third party, enforcing the conditions automatically.

Properties:
Trustless: No need to rely on traditional intermediaries (e.g., banks or brokers).

Secure: Funds are locked until the agreed-upon conditions are met.

Transparent: All conditions and balances are visible and auditable on-chain.

Automated Arbitration: A designated party (or logic) can approve or reject the release of funds.

Use Cases:
Real Estate: Holding buyer funds until property transfer is verified.

Charities: Releasing donations only when conditions or milestones are reached.

Marketplaces: Holding payment until delivery of goods or services.

Freelancing Platforms: Paying service providers only upon task completion.

Solidity Basics:
An escrow contract is one of the most straightforward yet powerful smart contracts.

A simple version usually includes:

deposit() function for locking funds

approve() or release() function to send funds to the recipient

Optional refund() function for disputes or cancellations

Letâ€™s Get Building:
Throughout this learning block, you'll write actual escrow logic in Solidity.

You'll also integrate this logic into a working web application to simulate real-world interactions.

Think about areas in your life or business where trustless transactions can create value.

Use your creativity to invent new dApps that automate trust through escrows!
