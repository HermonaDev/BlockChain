Key Concepts:
Approval mechanisms allow designated parties (e.g., an arbiter) to authorize fund transfers in smart contracts.

In an escrow, once the agreed-upon service is fulfilled, only the arbiter should be able to release the funds.

Funds are sent to the beneficiary, completing the transaction securely and transparently.

Properties:
Access-controlled: Only the arbiter should have the authority to approve fund transfers.

Final transfer: The entire contract balance is sent to the beneficiary.

External trigger: An external function can be called by accounts outside the contract.

Use Cases:
Escrow services: Release payment after job completion.

Marketplaces: Transfer funds after delivery confirmation.

Dispute resolution systems: Third-party resolves whether conditions are met.
