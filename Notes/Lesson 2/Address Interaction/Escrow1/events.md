Key Concepts:
Events in Solidity are mechanisms for logging important occurrences on the blockchain.

Frontends and external systems (like The Graph or dApps) can listen for events to stay updated with contract activity.

Events improve transparency, usability, and traceability in smart contracts.

Properties:
Events are not stored on-chain in the same way as state variables, making them cost-effective for logging.

They are recorded in the transaction’s log data, which can be accessed by applications and external tools.

Emitting an event is non-intrusive—it does not affect contract logic but improves visibility.

Use Cases:
Escrow approvals: Notify when funds are released.

Token transfers: Log every transfer for wallet and exchange interfaces.

Voting systems: Record and verify votes cast in DAOs.

Auctions or sales: Announce bids or sales outcomes.
