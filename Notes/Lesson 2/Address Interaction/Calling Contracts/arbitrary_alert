Key Concepts:
Functions in Solidity can accept arbitrary calldata as a parameter using bytes calldata.

This allows contracts to forward encoded function calls to other contracts.

It's especially powerful in scenarios where flexibility and delayed execution are required.

Properties:
bytes calldata is a read-only, gas-efficient way to handle input data from external calls.

Can be used to forward any function call, with any parameters, to another contract.

Enables storing and replaying exact calldata for governance systems or multi-signature wallets.

Works well with .call() for low-level, dynamic function invocation.

Use Cases:
Governance proposals: Save calldata for future execution upon approval.

Multi-sig wallets: Allow multiple parties to agree before executing a transaction.

Proxies and relayers: Forward arbitrary instructions to target contracts.

Modular dApps: Dynamically call different functions without hardcoding them.

Solidity Basics:
Use function relay(address target, bytes calldata data) to accept and forward calldata.

Call the target with: (bool success, ) = target.call(data);

Storing or relaying calldata makes the contract extensible and upgradeable.
