Key Concepts:
- Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on the blockchain.
- They automate agreements without intermediaries (e.g., banks, lawyers).
- Written in Solidity (for Ethereum) and deployed as bytecode.

Properties:
- Immutable: Cannot be changed after deployment.
- Deterministic: Same input â†’ same output, always.
- Transparent: Code is publicly verifiable.

Use Cases:
- Token creation (ERC-20, NFTs)
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- Voting systems

Solidity Basics:
Contracts resemble classes in OOP.
